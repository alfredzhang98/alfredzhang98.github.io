This work introduces a unique bioimpedance (BIOZ) guided haptic needle technology designed to enhance central venous catheterisation (CVC) procedures. The portable system combines real-time BIOZ analysis, needle posture tracking, and a haptic device specifically developed for CVC research. By providing real-time haptic feedback and BIOZ analysis, the system significantly improves precision, ensuring a 100% success rate for vein entry. During the demonstration, visitors will first experience the challenges of CVC without assistance. Then, using the platform, they will experience how the system improves accuracy by guiding the needle into a phantom of the vein, greatly increasing the insertion success rate.
