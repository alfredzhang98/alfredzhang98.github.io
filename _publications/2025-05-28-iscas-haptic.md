Central venous catheterisation (CVC) involves the precise and challenging task of needle insertion, which can be difficult and prone to complications. This paper presents a bioimpedance (BIOZ) system for precision needle navigation in CVC. The system integrates BIOZ with a haptic feedback mechanism to assist clinicians during the catheterisation procedure. Four types of embedded needle probes were designed for high-sensitivity BIOZ sensing. The probe integrates with a compact electronic handle system for real-time BIOZ measurement and data communication, enabling real-time tissue classification and haptic feedback for optimal needle positioning. In 24 experimental trials with user participation using a phantom model, the system demonstrated a 100% success rate in venous entry, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.66 mm and an 87% probability of achieving a position within Â±1 mm of the vein centre. The compact and portable design ensures compatibility with clinical settings, laying a foundation for future improvements in robotic-assisted CVC and procedures alike.
