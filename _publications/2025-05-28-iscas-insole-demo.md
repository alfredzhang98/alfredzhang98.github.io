This work presents a high-resolution plantarpressure measurement system designed to capture detailed footinformation for gait analysis. After training, the customizedregression model can estimate lower body joints positions inreal-time using foot pressure data. The demonstration willfeature a UK size 8 insole, equipped with 253 resistive pressuresensors wirelessly connected to the server. Visitors will havethe opportunity to experience walking with the insole,observing the plantar force distribution displayed and lowerbody joints as predicted by the model on the computer.
