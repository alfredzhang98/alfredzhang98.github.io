I am absolutely thrilled to announce that our project, the **"Haptic-enhanced bioimpedance needle for precision navigation,"** was honored with the **Best Demo Award** at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) in London!

It was an incredible experience to present our work to a community of leading researchers and engineers. Our demonstration showcased how the integration of haptic feedback with bioimpedance sensing can significantly improve the accuracy and safety of procedures like central venous catheterisation.

This award is a tremendous recognition of our team's hard work and dedication. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished and grateful for the insightful questions and positive feedback we received during the conference.
